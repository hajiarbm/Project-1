**Installation**

Nothing more than Anaconda is neede. The code is written in Python3. 


**Project Motivation**

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb to answer these questions:

    What percentage of the houses are less than $75?
    What is the percentage of strict cancellation policy?
    Among the rooms with  flexible cancellation policyhow many of them are less than $75?
    What is the information of the house with most reviews?


**File Descriptions**

There is  1 notebook with the code related to answer the above questions. The code is commented. 


**Results**

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/bfd5f531b2e8/edit)
